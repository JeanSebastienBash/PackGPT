# PackGPT

The main purpose of this script is minimalist: to simplify and speed up the automatic installation, in a single pass, of various generative artificial intelligence tools. It is intended for local use on a test server.

This script is specifically designed for use with a fresh minimal installation of Debian 12. It is imperative that the minimal version of Debian 12 does not contain any default system packages.

Current script version: 0.1
