# PackGPT - Generative AI Tools Installation Script for Debian Servers

The main purpose of this script is minimalist: to simplify and speed up the automatic installation, in a single pass, of various generative artificial intelligence tools. It is intended for local use on a test server.

This script is specifically designed for use with a fresh minimal installation of Debian 12. It is imperative that the minimum version of Debian 12 contains only ssh and the default system packages.

With this script, you can deploy up to 10 AI tools in less than 45 minutes, assuming you have a high-speed Internet connection and ssd. Once installed, the AI tools will occupy around 50 gigabytes of disk space on your server.

## Objective

Facilitate the installation process for artificial intelligence tools and enable them to coexist on the same Debian server.

## Benefits

- Simplified Setup: Achieve all this with just one single script.
- Time-saving: quickly install multiple tools in a single run.
- Centralization: group different AI tools on a single server.
